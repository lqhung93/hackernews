  "text": "Glad to see the update. I have experimented with both the macOS and Linux drops before and they were rough. v0.3.1 is focused on providing a productive platform.

In TensorFlow there is an un-understandable barrier (for me) between the Python layer and the lower level C++ code. Good to see this Swift effort along side Julia + Flux, which offers the same implementation language for the whole system advantage.",
